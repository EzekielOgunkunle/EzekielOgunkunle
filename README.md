# 👋 Hi, I'm Ezekiel Olubukola Ogunkunle

I’m a hands-on technologist who loves turning ideas into working systems — fast, clean, and scalable. I work across web, cloud, and embedded spaces, with a growing focus on DevOps and systems thinking. Right now, I’m deep into building platforms, learning the DevOps lifecycle, and experimenting with automation and open-source.

## ⚙️ What I'm Doing Now
- ⚡ Building platforms with **Django** and REST APIs
- 📦 Learning **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **CI/CD pipelines**
- 🐧 Diving deeper into **Linux server management and scripting**
- 🔄 Exploring **DevOps workflows** and infrastructure-as-code
- 🧠 Working on Odoo ERP customizations and automation

---

## 🤝 Open to Collaborate On
- ERP & backend systems (esp. **Odoo**, **Django**, **PostgreSQL**)
- DevOps automation projects (pipelines, infra, containers)
- Open-source contributions
- Clean, scalable codebases that solve real problems

### ⚡ Fun Fact:
I once fixed a stubborn bug by rewriting the whole feature — and it actually worked better.  
I build with intention, I learn fast, and I care deeply about doing things right.
